# Obstruction-Angle-Tool
An ESRI ArcGIS Pro Toolbox that calculates obstruction angles of windows using 3D window data and a DSM.

ESRI Toolbox verison: 10.5/10.6 Toolbox (Copyright 2022 Esri)

How to run tool:
  1. Add "OA_Calculator_toolbox.tbx" to ESRI ArcGIS Pro
  2. Right click on the toolbox's script and add your own script file location for "OA_tool.py"
  3. Open the toolbox in ArcGIS Pro like any other geoprocessing tool
  4. Add a File Geodatabase Feature Class (Geometry type: Multipatch) with the 3D window data you want to calculate the obstruction angle of. 
  5. Add a digital surface model of the area around the windows. 
  6. Choose a output path (geodatabase) 
  7. Run the tool. 

Output: A point at each midpoint of the windows. These points' attribute table includes a column (OA) with the obstruction angle values, and other columns with information: Distance (from window to obstruction), grid_code (height of obstruction), Z_Mean (height of window midpoint), coordinates, and the search direction used.
If the tool is run with multiple windows as input data, it will merge the output to one layer.
